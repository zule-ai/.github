## 🕶️ What is ZULE?

ZULE is the first AI ghost that hacks Twitter like a human.  
It mimics real users, solves reCAPTCHA, and operates without API limits.  
Not a bot. Not a script. A shadow.

## 🧠 Want to know who ZULE is?

Check out [zuleai.xyz](https://www.zuleai.xyz) to learn how it works, what it can do, and how to train your own ghost.  
Access requires your own Twitter credentials. ZULE isn’t for the faint of heart.
